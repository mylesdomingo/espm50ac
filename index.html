                            PG&E, the Electric Company that serves California, had desperately tried to stop new 
                            fires but shutting off power to prevent lines from catching fire. In a technological world, 
                            lack of access to power resulted to mass disruption to the lives of citizens. Nearly a 
                            million people were affected. Work and classes are cancelled, facilities are temporarily 
                            closed — entire cities come to a complete halt. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Yet, despite several rounds of deliberate blackouts to reduce wildfire risk, it failed. 
                            The Getty Fire, presumed to be started by a downed power line, ignited near Los Angeles 
                            in November 2019, forcing the evacuation of thousands of people. It seems that wildfire 
                            season is getting more and more out of control every year. Is it?

                            Fires are a normal player in a forest’s ecosystem — a cycle that allow trees to burn, 
                            rejuvenate, make way for life anew. However, the suppression of fires in the past have 
                            done more harm than good — leaving behind stacks of fuel to accumulate and increase 
                            hazardous conditions. Over the scale of decades, these fires can act on a scale that 
                            is beyond human control, as seen in the next section.

                            These are the results of Camp Fire in 2018 , the states recently most deadliest and 
                            destructive wildfire. The fire burned throughout a small town named Paradise near Chico, 
                            California. The effects of its rampage has left properties destroyed, thousands homeless, 
                            and loved ones lost.

                            The reason for Camp Fires destruction? Nearly perfect conditions for fire to spread. 
                            Climate change over the past decade has increased temperatures, dried crops and vegetation, 
                            increased winds. The influx of organic fuel and oxygen was made this wildfire so potent.

                                According to Vox, most wildfire deaths are not from the fires themselves but the 
                                inhalation of smoke that it produces. The particle matter and gases emitted by combustion 
                                pose a common health threat. These particles, denoted as PM2.5 for being smaller than 2.5
                                microns in diameters, spread far distances through airborne travel. When inhaled, it increases 
                                an individuals risk to asthma attacks and lung cancer.

                                Especially for the youth, elderly, and those with pre-existing conditions, 
                                PM2.5 is a serious concern. Areas like Oakland and Fresno have reach up to 150-250 AQI, 
                                far above safe air conditions. Some of the worst areas affected by air pollution, 
                                like Sacramento, have declared public health emergencies. N95 respirator masks are a 
                                common preventative measure in areas of high pollution. But these pose a serious 
                                socioeconomic concern — how do we ensure adequate access and distribution to all 
                                those affected. Limited quantity, and additional financial costs pose problems for 
                                those especially in poorer socioeconomic classes.

                        As fires grow, so will air quality worsen. Massive wildfires have led to a mass decrease 
                        in air quality throughout the united states. And as people continue to build closer to
